# vimsort

[![This project is considered stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-success.svg)](https://benknoble.github.io/status/stable/)

Sort your lines with text objects (like `ap`) and visual mode!

## Usage

By default, `gs` is overridden in Normal and Visual mode to be a sort operator.
So `gsap` will sort the lines of a paragraph.

You can configure the mapping: see `:help vimsort-configuration`.
